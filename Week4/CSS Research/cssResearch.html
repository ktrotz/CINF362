        <div class="row">

                <p> For this research topic, I chose to expand on the CSS property of Animation. 
                    This property can be used to provide animations to other CSS properties
                    like background-color, height, etc. When using this property, @keyframe 
                    must be used to define that the inner code should be processed like
                    animation and what should happen at specific moments during the animation.</p>

                <p> Currently, @keyframes is supported by browsers, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, 
                    Safari, Firefox, and Opera. I think this property is used very often especially to 
                    replace and simply the need for JavaScript for simple animation tasks.</p>

                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p> The class "box" is defined in the CSS file and within the default box color and size are set.
                    The animation property is also defined with the name of the animation to be created, 
                    the duration of the entire animation and its looping sequence which is currently infinitely alternating.
                    @keyframes is then defined on its own along with the name of the animation. 
                    The transform property is used within here to allow for the animation to rotate the scale function to make it change size.
                </p>
